## Understanding Network Security & Basic Traffic Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of network security and basic network traffic monitoring. The objective is to learn how data travels across networks, identify common network protocols, and analyze packet-level information using safe and legal tools without performing any malicious activities.

## Objectives
- Understand how data packets move across a network
- Learn basic network security concepts
- Identify common network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS)
- Perform basic packet capture and analysis
- Understand common network-based threats conceptually
- Practice ethical and legal traffic monitoring

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Wireshark (Network Packet Analyzer)
- Git & GitHub
- Operating System Network Interface
- Basic Networking Concepts (TCP/IP)

## Activities Performed
- Selected active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)
- Captured live network packets using Wireshark
- Applied protocol-based display filters
- Analyzed packet headers (IP, Port, Protocol)
- Observed encrypted vs unencrypted traffic

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding packet-level network data initially
- Identifying and differentiating protocols
- Interpreting IP addresses and port numbers
- Distinguishing normal traffic from suspicious patterns

## Outcomes
- Strong understanding of basic network security concepts
- Hands-on exposure to packet capture and analysis
- Awareness of how attackers exploit network weaknesses
- Improved analytical and observation skills
- Practical experience with industry-standard tools

## Lessons Learned
- Network security is essential for protecting data in transit
- Encryption plays a major role in secure communication
- Traffic monitoring helps detect abnormal behavior
- Ethical responsibility is critical in cybersecurity

## Conclusion
This task provided foundational knowledge of network security and traffic monitoring. By analyzing real network packets in a controlled and ethical manner, the project strengthens the understanding required for advanced cybersecurity concepts and real-world security analysis.
